# SecureTheVault
block 7 workshop

Pseudocode of my steps to solve the exercise
1. create starting files: index.html and script.js
2. include starting code on html file (Shift + ! + Enter). then use script tag to link the js file to your html file.
3. in js file, create a string that states: "You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination:"
4. in js file, create three variables, each with a different arithmetic operator (addition, substraction, etc) each operation gives a different part of the combo.
5. remember to add comments to the code to explain what's being done
6. in js file, create a dialog box to display the vault codes and the text using HTML and a script tag linking the js file.
7. submit using a github link to the repo
