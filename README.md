# SecureTheVault
block 7 workshop

Pseudocode of my steps to solve the exercise

1. create a string that states: "You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination:"
2. create three variables, each with a different arithmetic operator (addition, substraction, etc) each operation gives a different part of the combo.
3. remember to add comments to the code to explain what's being done
4. create a dialog box to display the vault codes and the text using HTML and a script tag linking the js file.
5. submit using a github link to the repo
